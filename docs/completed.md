# Completed things

## Projects (2024-03-13)

### Update (2024-03-07)

Probably, the better name for this section is **Categories**.

### Initial version

BTW, it might have the Projects section, so if you save activities in form of `ABC-123: Hello World`, you should be able to define the group or _project_ for them.

Like define a rule for all activities starting with `ABC-XXX:` - _Those activities are belongs to some project with name ABC._

And you should be able to set the Project description and get here some overview / analytics too.

## Issues view (2024-03-01)

I decided to make Issues view first. This view allow to oversee the summary of Issues. As it has a lot of different things to do, I decided to move specification into separate file.

See it [here](./issues).

## Add Copy button (06 Feb 2024)

Add the possibility to programmatically copy the Activity name via Copy button (`navigate.clipboard` or something like that).

## Turn on the HTTPS support (04 Feb 2024)

That is required to enable the next feature.

## Missing days (03 Feb 2024)

At the moment, if you miss a day, there is no way to write down some activities that day.

As solution, it is possible to go through the week and calculate missing days. If day is missing, then put some element in form of `card` or `alert` offering to create a day.
