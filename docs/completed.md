# Completed things

## Add Copy button (06 Feb 2024)

Add the possibility to programmatically copy the Activity name via Copy button (`navigate.clipboard` or something like that).

## Turn on the HTTPS support (04 Feb 2024)

That is required to enable the next feature.

## Missing days (03 Feb 2024)

At the moment, if you miss a day, there is no way to write down some activities that day.

As solution, it is possible to go through the week and calculate missing days. If day is missing, then put some element in form of `card` or `alert` offering to create a day.
