# Roadmap

## Responsiveness

Skipping responsiveness during the initial development was a mistake, and its absence is now greatly felt.

Incorporating responsiveness is crucial for enhancing the overall user experience.

## Dark Mode

Just as it says.

## Progressive Web Application

Converting the Timesheet Web Application to a PWA (Progressive Web App) will make it more versatile and accessible across different devices.

Ability to install the app on desktops or mobile devices enables offline access and faster load times.

Additionally, the PWA can offer push notifications and a more seamless user experience, similar to a native application, while still being web-based. This enhancement will significantly improve user engagement and convenience.

## Configuration View

Given the diverse work schedules—part-time, four-day workweeks, and more—it’s essential to make the application configurable.

By allowing customization, the application will better accommodate different work patterns, resulting in more accurate time tracking and reporting.

## Analytics View

For those times when you need detailed insights, whether preparing a report, overseeing completed work, or tracking down a specific activity from months ago, the Analytics View will be invaluable.

It will provide powerful tools for effectively managing and analyzing your data.

## Cloud Service

An optional backend application is planned for users who prefer to store their data outside the browser and sync it across multiple devices.

This backend may not only provide seamless data access from any computer but will also offer enhanced reporting and administrative functionality.

These additional features may be particularly beneficial to managers, offering deeper insights and better control over time tracking data.
