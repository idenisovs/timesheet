# Issues view

## To Do

### Possibility to search issues

Add search field to find a issue by specific keyword.

### Activity names without index

Probably it is good thing to treat activities without indexes as issues.

### Highlight Activity

Depending on what kind of activity it is:

- If activity has a name specific to issues, like `ABC-123: Testing`, then it might be highlighting like green.

## Completed

### Possibility to define an issue (2024-03-06)
