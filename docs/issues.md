# Issues view

## To Do

### Issue name to daily overview

Daily Overview Modal should get the issue names. That was one of purposes why I made the whole Issue thing here.

### Activity names without index

Probably it is good thing to treat activities without indexes as issues.

### Add possibility to remove the issue

SUBJ

### Highlight Activity

Depending on what kind of activity it is:

- If activity has a name specific to issues, like `ABC-123: Testing`, then it might be highlighting like green.

### Possibility to define an issue

User should be able to add a issue without related activities. 

### Issues list grouped by month

Probably it is wise idea to group issues by months. 

### Possibility to search issues

Add search field to find a issue by specific keyword.

## Completed

### The name of activity to issue (2024-03-01)

If activity relates to the issue, which is not in store (a completely new issue), then name of activity should come to issue.

### Particular Issue View (2024-02-26)

And here comes possibility to see the details or edit separate issue.
