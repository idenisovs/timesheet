# ToDo

This file contains list of things and thoughts about features I'd like to put in Timesheet App.

## Infinite Scroll

Add Infinite Scroll option to Daily Activity View. It should help to deal with huge lists of activities.

## Activity Ordering

Add option to order Activities in Daily Activity View.

## Minor changes

- The Project View should have the Remove button from Project Edit View;
- Switch the Import and Export buttons;
- Probably Import / Export should have the separate view;

## Analytics

I'd like to put some Analytics here, so you'll be able to get all or some project / issue overview across any period of time.

### Tags

I think there should be possibility to mark activities with tags. Therefore, there will be possibility to make and process metadata.

## Sync

This project from the very beginning is thought not to store the User's data with cloud services.

I added CSV file export and import in order to move data across the different devices (and make the backups too) but I still have a feeling that it is not enough. 

So I'm thinking about some backend API that might store the user's data **with user's permission**.

Like in form of one-time shareable links and QR Codes.

## Organizations

I have some thoughts about adapting time tracking Timesheet App for the business needs and sell the time tracking service. Going to have the big vision for this.
