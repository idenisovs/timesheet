# Timesheet

There is plenty of time tracking apps, and most of them unfortunately have long-standing usability and complexity issues. That the reason why I finally decided to write my own Timesheet application.

Online version of Timesheet App is hosted [here](http://time.e-dreams.lv/).

## Goals

1. Make the time tracking task as simple as possible;
2. Make it serverless first. All the data stored in browser;
3. Make it free and open-source;

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
