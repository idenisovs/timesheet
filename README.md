## Motivation

As a professional Software Developer, I frequently used various commercial time tracking applications, but none provided a comfortable user experience due to numerous UI/UX issues. Ultimately, this led me to create my own time tracking application, designed with a focus on simplicity, usability, and efficiency.

## Goals

1. Make the time tracking task as simple as possible;
2. Make it serverless first. All the data stored in browser;
3. Make it free and open-source;
