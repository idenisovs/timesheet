# Timesheet

Yet another (serverless) time tracking web application.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Motivation 

As a professional Software Developer, I frequently used various commercial time tracking applications, but none provided a comfortable user experience due to numerous UI/UX issues. Ultimately, this led me to create my own time tracking application, designed with a focus on simplicity, usability, and efficiency.

[Online version of Timesheet App](https://time.e-dreams.lv/).

## Goals

1. Make the time tracking task as simple as possible;
2. Make it serverless first. All the data stored in browser;
3. Make it free and open-source;
